# ðŸ“¦ Production Database Migration Instructions

## Overview
This guide will help you migrate your development database configuration to production so you can publish your Atlas AI application.

## What Will Be Migrated
- âœ… **3 Plans**: Free, Pro, Enterprise (with all feature flags and limits)
- âœ… **11 AI Models**: Across 4 providers (Anthropic, Groq, OpenAI, Perplexity)
- âœ… **Coupon Schema Verification**: Ensures tables exist (no data to migrate)

## Prerequisites
- Access to Replit Database Pane
- Production database provisioned
- Admin permissions to execute SQL

---

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### Step 1: Access Production Database
1. Open your Replit project
2. Click on **Tools** in the left sidebar
3. Select **Database**
4. **Important**: Switch from "Development" to **"Production"** using the environment toggle at the top

### Step 2: Prepare Migration Script
1. The migration script is ready in: `production-migration.sql`
2. Open this file in your Replit editor
3. **Copy the entire contents** (all 249 lines)

### Step 3: Execute Migration
1. In the Database Pane (Production environment), click the **SQL Console** tab
2. **Paste the entire migration script** into the query editor
3. **Review the script** one final time to ensure you're in PRODUCTION
4. Click **Run** or **Execute**

### Step 4: Verify Migration Success
The script includes automatic verification queries at the end. You should see:

**Expected Results:**
```
plan_count: 3
plan_names: Enterprise, Free, Pro

Provider Model Counts:
- anthropic: 3 models
- groq: 3 models  
- openai: 3 models
- perplexity: 2 models

total_active_models: 11

Coupon Tables:
- pro_coupons_table_status: EXISTS
- pro_coupon_redemptions_table_status: EXISTS
```

### Step 5: Verify in Admin Dashboard
1. Ensure your app is running: `npm run dev`
2. Login as Super Admin
3. Navigate to **Admin Dashboard** â†’ **Plans & Features** â†’ **Plans Management**
4. Verify you see 3 plans: Free, Pro, Enterprise
5. Navigate to **System & Policies** â†’ **Model Catalog & Pricing**
6. Verify you see all 11 models

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Table does not exist" error
**Solution:** Run database migrations in production first:
```bash
npm run db:push
```
Then retry the migration script.

### Issue: "Duplicate key" error
**Solution:** The script includes DELETE statements, but if you still see this error, you can manually delete existing records first:
```sql
DELETE FROM models WHERE provider IN ('anthropic', 'groq', 'openai', 'perplexity');
DELETE FROM plans WHERE slug IN ('free', 'pro', 'enterprise');
```

### Issue: Coupon tables missing
**Solution:** The tables are created by Drizzle migrations. Ensure you've run:
```bash
npm run db:push
```
in your production environment.
