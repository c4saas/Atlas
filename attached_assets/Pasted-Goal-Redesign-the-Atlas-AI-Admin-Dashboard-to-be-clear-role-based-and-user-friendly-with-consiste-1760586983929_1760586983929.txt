Goal
Redesign the Atlas AI Admin Dashboard to be clear, role-based, and user friendly, with consistent backend alignment.



1. Roles & Permissions
Define 3 roles with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Super Admin
	•	Full control of all system prompts, policies, plans, features, API access, and user management.  
	•	Can create, edit, and delete Admins.  
Admin
	•	Manage Users, assign Plans, configure Features, manage Knowledge Base, and Agents.  
	•	Can view but not edit System Prompts or Tool Policies.  
	•	Cannot override Super Admin actions.  
User
	•	Limited to their own workspace: Plans, Knowledge Base, Memory, Templates, Projects.  
	•	Can view their assigned Agents.  
	•	No access to System Prompts, Policies, API Access, or User Management.  



2. Sidebar Structure (UI Layout)
Create a collapsible sidebar with grouped items:
System & Policies
	•	System Prompts  
	•	Output Templates  
	•	Tool Policies & Release Notes  
Plans & Features
	•	Plans & Models  
	•	Knowledge Base  
	•	Memory  
	•	Templates & Projects  
AI Agents
	•	Manage Agents  
	•	Expert Library  
Access & Integrations
	•	API Access  
	•	Access Codes  
	•	User Management  



3. Role → Feature Mapping (RBAC Matrix)
Super Admin
- Full access to all sidebar items

Admin
- Plans & Features (all items)
- AI Agents (all items)
- Access & Integrations (all items except API keys)
- System & Policies (view only)

User
- Plans & Features (only their own plan, memory, templates, projects)
- AI Agents (view assigned agents only)
- No access to System, Policies, API Access, or User Management




4. Deliverables for Development
You will:
	1	Implement RBAC (Super Admin, Admin, User) with backend enforcement.  
	2	Redesign Sidebar Navigation based on structure above.  
	3	Link each sidebar item to the appropriate backend module or feature.  
	4	Apply access filters so each role only sees what they are allowed.  
	5	Provide breadcrumb navigation inside each section for clarity.  
	6	Include toggle for future features (e.g., Expert Library expansions).  



5. Milestones
	1	Build RBAC backend (roles + permissions enforcement).  
	2	Create Sidebar UI with groups.  
	3	Map Sidebar items → role access.  
	4	Test navigation flows (Super Admin → Admin → User).  
	5	Add breadcrumbs & UI polish.  
	6	Deploy for internal test, then expand.
